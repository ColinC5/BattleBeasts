Battle Beasts

### What you planned to do
- [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/2) Create temporary sprites so that group members can build around them. 
- [#10](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/10) Make logo for executable
- [#16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/16) Create the beasts, including names and types in 16x16 pixel art. 

### What you did not do
- Did not finish creating all 10 beasts. Made 3. 

### What problems you encountered
- Seems like a lot of the coding aspects regarding the beasts are dependent on other members work. There may be communication issues on what we expect to accomplish this semester.  

### Issues you worked on

### What you accomplished
- Created the graphic for 3 beasts and the icon using Piskel. These are 16x16 pixels each. Named and determined the type for these.  
- Created a parent class (2D node) called Beasts and gave it basic variables for health, defence, attack. 
- Created the outline for 3 children of the Beasts class, 1 for each of the beasts I have developed.
