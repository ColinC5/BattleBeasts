### What problems you encountered
I had a pretty large learning curve for Godot. It took a while for me to understand how to use C# in Godot. It was hard to find documentation on C# because most of it was in GDScript. After a while, I figured out that they were almost the same except for some small differences. This took up a lot of time and so I could only get two of the issues done.

### Accomplished
* [#15](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/15)  Make bracket for tournament
  - Gave the user 2 options: big (8 people) tournament or small (4 people) tournament.
  - After choosing the tournament size, a bracket is drawn to to show the tournament and your position in it.
  - If it is the first time to the bracket, the user will press continue and go to the fight scene
  - Otherwise, the user should press the win or lose button depending on if they lost or won.
  - If user wins, they advance in the bracket. If user loses, it takes them back to the title screen.
  - If user win the entire tournament, a winning statement is made, and they press the exit button to return to the title screen

* [#14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/14)  Create a scene to enter username
  - When entering this screen, user is greeted by a person and his Battle Beast and asked to enter their name.
  - After entering the user name, the user is welcomed to the world of Battle Beasts and has the option to continue to the bracket.
  - The username is then saved to keep up with throughout the game.

* Globals.cs
  - This is an extra file I made that helps with my issues.
  - This file provides global variables that will be used across the game.
  - As of now it keeps up with the level to advance you through the bracket.
  - It also keeps up with the player name and bracket size (big or small).
