# Sprint 1

- Jake Looney - jlooney6
- github: 6a6c
- Group: BattleBeasts

### What you planned to do
Issues:
- #1 Implement title/home screen
- #3 Create and implement background/title music
- #13 Team selection menu

### What you did not do
While I was able to accomplish some of all of my issues, I feel like I really could have done more on the title page beyond the simple animation.
In addition, more could have been done with linking from the team selection screen.

### What problems you encountered
The biggest problem I ran into was just learning the jank of Godot. While it is helpful to so eaisly create graphics, the Godot API is pretty counter intuitive and hard to learn.
However, I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it and should be faster at it in the future.

### Issues you worked on
Issues worked on were only #1 (Home screen), #3 (Create music), and #13 (Team building screen)

### Files you worked on
For code the files I worked on were Menus/TitleScreen.tscn/cs and Menus/TeamSelect.cs/tscn. 
For raw files, I added Assets/Music/TitleTheme.mp3 (created using Logic Pro)

### What you accomplished
Overall, I accomplished a good ammount this week by learning Godot, creating the title screen, the team select screen, and created music.
