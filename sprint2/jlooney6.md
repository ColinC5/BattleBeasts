# Sprint 2

- Jake Looney - jlooney6
- github: 6a6c
- Group: BattleBeasts

### What you planned to do
Issues:
- #13 Team selection
- #55 Implement music for battle scene
- #56 Implement menu sound effects

### What you did not do
I was able to add and implement the music and sound effects, but didn't get to do as much as I would've liked to on the Team Select screen. I did make some changes but others also helped with how we implemented and linked the scene to other scenes.

### What problems you encountered
One problem I encountered is dealing with Godot's audio system. Sometimes concurrent streams won't line up or there will be some clicking. I think I figured out how to fix the bugs but still have to implement. 
Another thing that was kind of difficult to work through just as a group was how to link scenes with Beast info, but now we've got it all figured out.

### Issues you worked on
Worked on #13, #55, #56, and other misc. small bugs

### Files you worked on
For code the files I worked on were Menus/TitleScreen.tscn/cs, Menus/TeamSelect.cs/tscn, Fight/Fights.cs, Menus/Options.cs, Menus/Credits.cs, but many of these edits were simple sound effect additions.
For raw files, I added battle music to Assets/Music.

### What you accomplishedi
Overall, while I did accomplish what I needed to, I feel like could have done more this sprint. I was much more busy with other classes this sprint but should be more free next sprint to hopefully add more.
