# Sprint 2
- Stephanie Hill

- Battle Beasts

### What you planned to do
- [#29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/29) Health Bar 
- [#16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/16) Beast Creation
- [#11](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/11) Move Creation

### What you did not do
For the health bar [#29] I was not able to display the modifiers on opponenet name as this relied on features no yet implemented in the scene. 

### What problems you encountered
Godot was not properly importing variables from VScode. So to get the health bar to implement properly I had to switch back to the Godot editor briefly until the software recognized the variable. 

### Issues you worked on
- [#29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/29) Health Bar 
- [#16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/16) Beast Creation
- [#11](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/11) Move Creation

### Files you worked on
- Assests/Character_Sprites/Bunpir.png
- Assests/Character_Sprites/Glabbagool.png
- Fight/Fight.cs
- Fight/HealthInterface.cs
- Fight/HealthInterface.tcn
- Data/Attacks.json
- Data/Beasts.json

### What you accomplished
I developed 2 more beasts, for a total of 5 beasts. Added these beasts to the Beasts.json file. In the Attacks.json file I came up with 6 moves per beast for a total of 30 moves. These moves are "type specific". For example Auril is an ice-type beast. All 6 moves for this beast are also ice-type. I also created a health bar. This displays the beast's current health as a percentage. Above the health bar it shows the player's username. Another instance of the health bar displays the opponent's health.
