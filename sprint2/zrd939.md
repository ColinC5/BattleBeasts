# Sprint 2

Name: Noah Dahle
Github ID: noahd15
Group name: Battle Beasts

### What you planned to do
- [28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/28) Add to bracket display.
- [35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/35) create beast for opposing player
- [27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/27) used fight outcome to determine if someone won

### What you did not do
I did everything I was assigned to do.
I want to do more with the beast creation, but I completed what was in the caption of the issues.

### What problems you encountered
A big problem I had was trying to figure out how to use JSON files in godot. This took me a while to figure out. I also had a bug where the beasts weren't showing up on the bracket at different levels.

### Issues you worked on
- [28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/28) Add to bracket display.
- [35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/35) create beast for opposing player
- [27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/27) used fight outcome to determine if someone won

### Files you worked on
- [BattleBeasts/Bracket/Bracket.cs](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Bracket/Bracket.cs)
- [BattleBeasts/Username/Enter_Name.cs](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Username/Enter_Name.cs)
- [BattleBeasts/Globals.cs](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Globals.cs)
- [BattleBeasts/Fight/Fight.cs](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Fight/Fight.cs)
- [BattleBeasts/Username/username.cs](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Username/username.cs)
- [BattleBeasts/Data/Opponents.json](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/blob/main/Data/Opponents.json)

### What you accomplished

* [28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/28)
  - displayed player's beast on the bracket
  - displayed opposing beast on the bracket before the game starts
  - put usernames with beasts.
  - made opponent names (maybe JSON)

* [35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/35)
  - created the opposing beast using a random number generator.
  - I used the opponents JSON file and used a random number generator to pick a random opponent. Each opponent has a specific beast index, and I use that index to find the beast in the beast JSON file.

* [27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/27) 
  - indicates who won a match in globals.cs
  - used fight outcome from globals.cs to either advance player in the bracket or end the game. Once this information is used/recorded the bracket resets the value in globals.cs to a neutral value
