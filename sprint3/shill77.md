# Sprint 3
- Stephanie Hill
- stephhill77
- Battle Beasts

### What you planned to do
- [#54](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/54) Health Bar as Fraction
- [#62](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/62) Beast Modifiers
- [#81](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/81) Load Moves into Fight Scene

### What you did not do
I was able to complete everything I set out to accomplish. 

### What problems you encountered
Did not realize there was a bug with how moves and modifiers were moved into the next round until late last night. So that will need to be fixed this sprint. 
Also had an issue with how Godot handles text. Dynamic font size is difficult. So I had to work around that by adjusting the initial font size and then figuring out how to make the button size fixed to the width of the container.  

### Issues you worked on
- [#54](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/54) Health Bar as Fraction
- [#62](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/62) Beast Modifiers
- [#81](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/BattleBeasts/issues/81) Load Moves into Fight Scene

### Files you worked on
- Fight/Fight.cs
- Fight/HealthInterface.cs

### What you accomplished
Instead of displaying health as a percentage, it now displays as a fraction of health. This makes it easier to for the user to see the number of health points their beast has and compare it to their opponents. Modifiers for the player and opponent now display next to the username of each beast in the battle. And the moves that the player selects are now shown on the move select buttons in the fight scene.
