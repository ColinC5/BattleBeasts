# Sprint 3

- Jake Looney - jlooney6
- github: 6a6c
- Group: BattleBeasts

### What you planned to do
Issues:
- #55 Implement music for battle scene
- #76 Quicktime event minigame for fight scene
- #82 Fight scene animations/feedback
- #85 Split volume slider in options menu

### What you did not do
I didn't really get to adding feedback/animations on the fight scene. This was mostly because I didn't wanna do something wild without consulting with the group. I should be able to do this and other small comsetics that add alot next week.

### What problems you encountered
Much less problems this time, I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of Godot. Just miniscule problems of figuring out certain things with certain classes within Godot.

### Issues you worked on
Worked on #55, #76, #82, and other misc. small bugs

### Files you worked on
For code the files I worked on were Menus/OptionsMenu2.tscn/cs, Fight/Fights.cs, Bracket/Bracket.cs, and Fight/QuicktimeKeyboard.cs/tscn.
For raw files, I added battle and victory music to Assets/Music.

### What you accomplished
While I definitely could have accomplished more this sprint, I am feeling much better about how the project is looking at the end of the sprint. I feel I have accomplished the bulk of what I need to for the group and what is left is helping out with small changes to finish the project.
