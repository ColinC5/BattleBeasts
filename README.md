## Game Design
- Constraints
  - Short game loop
    - The game needs to have a game loop that can be experienced in a substantial amount in a few minutes (in the time we can present the game)
      - Tournament bracket for multiple fights with similar base functionality
    - Other parts of the game may be well served to be understood without much demonstration
      - "In our game we also have a progression system, a short campaign with exploration..."
- Game Loop
  - Tournament bracket?
  - Player customizes their beast(s) before game
    - Cards?
    - Skill points?
- Fights
  - Players (and computers) take turns performing actions
  - Minigames like in Undertale combat?
- Stretch
  - Campaign?
  - Adventure like Pokemon?
