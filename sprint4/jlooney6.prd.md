## Background
Many people enjoy playing turn based battle games. However, many of these types of games take hours in order to customize characters. In addition, few battle games are on desktop apps, and instead are usually on consoles or handhelds. Our game solves this by allowing for quick customization in a desktop game that is quickly playable and replayable.

## Product Overview
Battle Beasts is a turned based battle game with a bracket progression system. Beast customization and fights are quick, allowing for replayability.

### Main Menu
The main menu of Battle Beasts allows players to navigate between the tuturial, the options menu, the credits, and to start a game.

### Beast Customization
After starting a game and entering their username, the player is greeted with the beast customization screen. Here, the user will select a beast, their beast's modifier, and then select four moves for their beast to use in combat. When the player is satisfied with their beast, they press Go to continue.

### Bracket
After beast customization, the user may choose between a Regular (up to 2 matches) or Ultimate (up to 3 matches) bracket. Upon winning a match, the player will advance in the bracket. Upon losing, the player will have to exit and start over.

### Fight
The fight scene shows the user's beast, an AI oppoonent's beast, the beasts' respective health, and the players four moves. Upon selecting a move, the player must play a minigame. The better the player does in the minigame, the more damage an attack will do. The fight continues until one beasts' health drops to zero.

#### Power Slider Minigame
Here, the player must press the space bar to stop the slider as close to the center as possible. The closer to the center, the more damage the attack will do.

#### Quick Time Minigame
Here, the player must react quickly and press a key on their keyboard. The faster the user presses the key, the more damage the attack will do.

#### Bullet Hell
Here, the player must control a miniturized version of their beast to dodge incoming bullets. The health of the player for the minigame is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The more health the player has at the end of the minigame, the more damage the attack will do.
