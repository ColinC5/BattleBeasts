## Background
Turn based games are incredibly popular right now. But most of these games do not have the customization abilities and replayability value that our game offers. 

## Project Overview
Battle Beasts is a turn based game where you customize a beast to compete in a tournament by fighting against other beasts.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you 
can create new items. Give a title or feature name for each story. Example: 
1. **Account holder withdraws cash.** As a customer,	I want to withdraw cash from an ATM,	so that I donâ€™t have to wait in line at the bank.
2. **Create Account.** As a new user, I want to register by creating a username and password so that the system can remember me and my data
1. **Sprite creation** As a user, I want to have distinguishable characters to choose from.
2. **Moves creation** As a user, I want to be able to choose which moves my character has, and for those moves to be different between character types. 
3. **Make logo** As a user, I need a launch icon that is different from my other desktop icons. 
4. **Make health bar** As a player, I need to be able to see what mine and my opponent's health points are. 
5. **Make hp a fraction** As a player, having the health bar show as a fraction of a whole instead of as a percentage allows me to visualize how many health points I start with compared to my opponent.
6. **Beast names** As a player, the beasts need distguishable names so that I can properly reference them. 
7. **Modifiers and names labels** As a player, I'm not sure which health bar is mine vs. my opponents. I need a way to tell who my opponent is and what modifiers they have, as well as which modifier my beast has. 
8. **Minigames** As a player, I would love for minigames to influence my attack power, to increase replayability
