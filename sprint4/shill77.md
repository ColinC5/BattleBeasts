### Files you worked on
-BattleBeats/Bracket/Bracket.cs

### What you accomplished
I modified the existing code to allow for more flexibility if the json files were altered to include more beasts, moves, or mods. Originally a switch statement was used to choose the beast texture, but I modified that code to pull from the json file and load the image that way. I also made changes to how moves for opponents were defined.
